# Heap-Simulator
Assignment for the Programming Languagues course as part of the Bsc. Computer Science curriculum at UFF.

This project was implemented using Linked list, an array and dictionary to mimic the memory heap of OS's.

It reads instructions from a .txt file and outputs to console.
By default it starts with 25 heap size and reads from the program.txt file at the project's source directory.
To change this, change the value of the HEAP_SIZE variable and the call to Program(), respectively.
